const name = "Vaibhav"
const repoCount = 50


//console.log(name + repoCount + "Value")

//``----- String interpulation (We create place holder and directely inject any variables)

//This syntax is much more readable in backend development
console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my repo couunt is ${repoCount}`)
